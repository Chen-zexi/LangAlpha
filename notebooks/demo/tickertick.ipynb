Anthropic has debuted a higher-priced subscription version of its Claude artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot. The startup’s Max plan, announced Wednesday (April 9), is designed for users who work extensively with Claude and require expanded access for their most important tasks. This plan also gives users priority access to Anthropic’s newest features and models. “The top request from our most active users has been expanded Claude access,” the announcement said. “The new Max plan delivers exactly that. With up to 20x higher usage limits, you can maintain momentum on your most demanding projects with little disruption.” According to Anthropic, the Max plan lets users choose from two levels: “Expanded Usage,” a plan priced at $100 per month and designed for frequent users who work with Claude on a variety of tasks; and Maximum Flexibility, costing $200 per month, for daily users who collaborate often with Claude for most tasks. “More usage unlocks more possibilities to collaborate with Claude, whether for work or life,” the company said. “At work, it means you can build Projects around any work task—whether it be writing, software, or data analysis—and really collaborate with Claude until your outcomes are just right.” Anthropic rival artificial intelligence startup OpenAI debuted a $200-per-month “research grade” version of its ChatGPT tool in December. Last week, Anthropic rolled out Claude for Education, which lets universities come up with and implement AI-powered approaches to teaching, learning and administration. The company said recently that it was more interested in developing generalist foundation AI models for enterprise users than for building hardware or consumer entertainment offerings. Speaking at the HumanX conference in March, Anthropic Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger said the company was focused on balancing research breakthroughs and product development. “We want to help people get work done, whether it’s code, whether it’s knowledge work, etc.,” he said. “And then you can then imagine different manifestations of that” in applications for the consumer, small business and up to large corporations and the C-suite. Also Wednesday, PYMNTS spoke with AI experts on Meta’s newest Llama AI model, which features a context window of up to 10 million tokens — or around 7.5 million words — almost 10 times the amount of Google’s Gemini 2.5. Ilia Badeev, head of data science at Trevolution Group, told PYMNTS that his team was still marveling at Gemini 2.5’s 1 million context window when Llama 4 launched. “This is an enormous number. With 17 billion active parameters, we get a ‘mini’ level model (super-fast and super-cheap) but with an astonishingly large context. And as we know, context is king,” Badeev said. “With enough context, Llama 4 Scout’s performance on specific applied tasks could be significantly better than many state-of-the-art models.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

       "   'description': 'Return-to-office mandates have been unpopular among all kinds of employees, whether they work for the private sector or federal government. Despite vocal discontent, companies have generally pressed on with these policies—often tasking human resources and people teams with implementing and enforcing them. It turns out many of the HR leaders who seemingly promote these policies have their misgivings, according to a report from people management platform Leapsome. In a survey of about 1,000 leaders—who oversee HR teams in the U.S. and a handful of European countries—more than half said they were pressured by their company’s CEO to enforce RTO policies that required workers to be in the office for a set number of days. Those pressures were even greater among American companies, with 63% of HR leaders in the U.S. reporting that their CEOs had pushed them to embrace return-to-office mandates. And yet, an overwhelming majority of those leaders (81%) believe strict RTO policies are ineffective. In fact, 42% of them say flexibility is the most important element of enabling collaboration. That’s contrary to what many CEOs have preached as they brought employees back into the office. Most of the HR leaders surveyed also claim that allowing people to work where they want improves overall productivity. Employee resistance to RTO If anything, RTO policies can actually damage trust among workers, according to the report, and make it more difficult for employers to recruit new employees successfully—something HR leaders already seem to be experiencing. Sixty percent of them say that employees are resisting RTO mandates. Across private companies and federal agencies, stringent policies that mandate five days a week in the office have led employees to quit or look for new jobs. The Pew Research Center has found that nearly half of remote workers would leave their jobs if they could no longer work from home. Hundreds of Amazon workers who were surveyed in late 2024 said they were looking for other opportunities or planned to quit this year, in anticipation of the company’s new policy taking effect. And over the past two months, about 75,000 federal workers have accepted deferred resignation offers, partly driven by Trump eliminating remote work arrangements for all employees. Challenges of RTO implementation As some legal experts have pointed out, these RTO policies can also lead companies to inadvertently discriminate against certain employees, especially if mandates are enforced inconsistently; top performers who are considered more valuable may get more leeway when it comes to office attendance. The push to get employees back in the office also has an outsize impact on the people who benefited most from flexible working arrangements, from disabled workers to caregivers. It seems many HR leaders are acutely aware of this issue, not to mention what the ripple effects might be on workplace culture. More than half of the leaders surveyed said RTO mandates are “detrimental” for disabled workers and that those policies were at odds with company efforts to promote inclusion. The impact of the DEI backlash As conservative politicians and right-wing activists threaten diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives across the workforce, about a third of HR leaders are also concerned about broader changes that could undermine DEI work, including budget cuts. The HR leaders who were surveyed argue that when workers see their employers cutting back on DEI programs, it can compromise performance and satisfaction and drive employees out of the company. (In a recent report from the research insights firm Gravity Research, many companies expressed concerns over how their employees would react to DEI cuts and that they felt pressured to make internal statements reaffirming their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.) Corporate leaders may have their reasons for reevaluating their DEI efforts and embracing RTO mandates—but there can be real costs to making those changes.'},\n",

In a continuing whirlwind of policy changes, President Donald Trump on Wednesday dropped tariffs under his new trade plan to 10% on imports from most countries for 90 days. Trump also said in a social media post that he was raising tariffs imposed on imports from China to 125%. “Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” Trump wrote. He unveiled a broad “reciprocal” tariff plan for all U.S. trade partners April 2, including a baseline 10% tariff on trade partners, as well as 25% tariffs on certain imported vehicles and auto parts arriving into the U.S. The wide-ranging reciprocal tariff policy went into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, including various levies on imports from about 90 U.S. trading partners. More than 75 countries have contacted U.S. officials to negotiate a solution to trade tariffs, according to Trump.

This whimsical yet pivotal thought sparked the creation of a novel robotic gripper built to revolutionize the agricultural sector. The device, aptly named GRIP-tape, capitalizes on the inherent properties of measuring tape, fundamentally changing the way fragile fruits and vegetables can be handled by machines. The project’s findings, published in the prestigious journal Science Advances, shed light on the innovative design that seamlessly merges functionality with simplicity. The drive to innovate came from recognizing the limited effectiveness of current robotic grippers that cater to soft and delicate objects. Traditional grippers, often large and cumbersome, utilize complex mechanisms to expand their gripping surface. This is where the ingenious design of GRIP-tape presents its advantages. By cleverly leveraging the robustness and flexibility of measuring tape, researchers have devised a solution that is not only low-cost but also inherently safe around humans—a critical consideration in agricultural applications. Furthermore, these technologically advanced grippers stand to significantly reduce the risk of damaging the fruits and vegetables they handle, thereby maximizing yield and minimizing waste. As outlined in the research published on April 9, 2025, the GRIP-tape operates on its unique premise: the accumulation of tape into a tightly coiled structure that can extend and retract as needed. This high-tech gripper comprises two “fingers,” each formed by two spools of measuring tape that are bonded together for stability and strength. When deployed, each finger unfurls diamond-shaped sections controlled independently by motors, allowing for an agile range of motion. This design not only enhances the gripping capabilities but also allows the gripper to reach further distances when required, effectively increasing its operational range. Adopting a non-traditional approach, the team has showcased that the inherent properties of measuring tape lend themselves extraordinarily well to robotic mechanisms. The springy quality of the tape allows it to maintain its shape and strength while adapting to various object contours. Importantly, the material properties of steel, combined with the gripper’s design principles, mimic the soft-touch requirements of many agricultural tasks without compromising structural integrity. Thus, the inventive use of measuring tape introduces a dynamic approach to robotic gripping technology. In terms of operational application, the GRIP-tape has shown exceptional promise in lifting not only singular pieces of produce, such as tomatoes and lemons, but also more complex structures like tomato vines. The versatility of the gripper lies in its capacity to adapt its gripping surface, relying on the entire length of the tape to grip various object shapes and stiffness. This multi-faceted advantage enables the gripper to operate effectively, making it an ideal candidate for both small-scale organic farms and large-scale agricultural operations. Additional functionality is incorporated into the design, as the tape can also operate in a conveyor belt mode. This feature not only facilitates the movement of picked items but also allows for efficient organization of harvested produce. The ability for the gripping appendage to maneuver around obstacles further emphasizes its translatability to diverse environments, whether they be rugged fields or meticulously arranged greenhouses. Building on their previous work regarding soft materials and robotics, the research team has highlighted the importance of continuous experimentation and iteration in achieving an effective design. The GRIP-tape project was partially funded by the National Science Foundation as part of a broader initiative to explore how engineering principles can be applied to create softer, more flexible robotic systems. This partnership exemplifies the ideal blend of funding and innovative research that has the potential to catalyze breakthroughs in the agriculturally focused robotics field. While the current version of the GRIP-tape is a substantial achievement, there are plans for enhanced iterations that will incorporate advanced sensors and artificial intelligence capabilities. Such upgrades would allow the gripper to analyze its environment in real time, adapting its operations autonomously. This progress represents a crucial step toward achieving the next generation of robotic assistants that can autonomously navigate complex agricultural tasks, making them an incremental but vital aspect of the industry’s future. In summary, the GRIP-tape represents a convergence of creativity and technical know-how, illustrating how inspiration drawn from simple concepts can lead to transformative technologies. This isn’t just about engineering an efficient gripping tool; it’s about rethinking how we integrate robotics into our everyday tasks and agricultural practices more responsibly and effectively. As human labor and agricultural practices evolve, innovations such as GRIP-tape offer not only practical solutions but also sustainable pathways for the future of food production—a compelling narrative about the marriage of science, engineering, and sustainable agriculture. The advances being made at UC San Diego signal a promising horizon, one where robotics play a crucial role in everyday processes while ensuring that our bounty from the earth is harvested with care and precision. As the conversation around sustainable farming continues to gain momentum, the importance of effective tools like the GRIP-tape cannot be overstated. The blending of ingenuity with pragmatism in robotic design will likely pave the way for broader acceptance of similar technologies in various sectors, echoing a future where machines and humans collaborate more harmoniously than ever. The implications of this research extend far beyond agriculture, inspiring future exploration into the application of soft robotics across various industries. As GRIP-tape clears the path for further developments, the potential for a safer, more effective integration of robotics into our daily lives seems not just attainable but within reach.

       "   'description': 'Xpeng Motors is officially rolling out its much-anticipated X9 — a flagship seven-seat electric MPV — with a global debut event on April 8. Xpeng Motors is officially rolling out its much-anticipated X9 — a flagship seven-seat electric MPV — with a global debut event on April 8. The company calls it a “super-comfortable, AI-empowered full-size MPV” designed to disrupt the family and premium mobility space in China and beyond.While the full specs remain under wraps ahead of the launch, Xpeng has been teasing a number of features that suggest a major leap in both comfort and intelligence. The X9 will reportedly run on Xpeng’s proprietary XNGP autonomous driving system, integrating advanced perception and decision-making capabilities for urban and highway scenarios. It is also expected to feature an enhanced version of the Xmart OS, offering voice-controlled smart cabin functions and immersive infotainment.From early leaks and test vehicle sightings, the X9 appears to combine sleek aerodynamic styling with a spacious, tech-forward interior — including captain’s chairs in the second row, large high-definition screens, and AI-driven climate and seat control systems. The MPV is expected to target family buyers and ride-hailing fleets, aiming to differentiate itself with high-level autonomy and comfort.Xpeng has been expanding its vehicle lineup aggressively in 2025, with a strategic focus on AI and full-stack in-house R&D.
