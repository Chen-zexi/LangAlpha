Analysis: Linking News to Price/Volume Movements\\n\\n- **Late March to Early April:** Nvidia’s stock peaked near $122, then sharply declined to ~$86 by April 7. This coincided with the announcement of new US export restrictions on AI chips to China, a key market for Nvidia. The company warned of a potential $5.5B hit to earnings, triggering heavy selling and a spike in trading volume.\\n- **Early to Mid-April:** The stock partially recovered as Nvidia’s GTC 2025 conference showcased major product innovations, and the CEO reaffirmed commitment to the Chinese market. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, competition from Huawei, and analyst downgrades kept the stock under pressure.\\n- **Volume Spikes:** The highest trading volumes aligned with the steepest price declines, indicating panic selling and possibly institutional repositioning in response to regulatory news.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Conclusion & Outlook\\n\\nNvidia’s -14% decline over the past month was primarily driven by negative regulatory news (US export bans to China), competitive threats (Huawei’s AI advances), and broader tech sector weakness. Despite these headwinds, the company’s continued innovation and strong product pipeline (as highlighted at GTC 2025) provide a foundation for long-term growth. Near-term volatility is likely to persist as geopolitical risks and competitive dynamics evolve.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- Price & volume data: Polygon API (2025-03-18 to 2025-04-17)\\n- News: Techmeme, Benzinga, Yahoo Finance, The New Stack, TechRadar, GuruFocus, WealthCreationInvesting, NextPlatform\\n\\nIf you need a visual plot or further breakdown of specific trading days, let me know!\\n</response>\\n\\n*Please execute the next step.*',\n",

The period was marked by sharp price drops, high trading volumes, and a partial recovery. The primary drivers of this performance were negative regulatory developments, competitive pressures, and broader weakness in the technology sector, partially offset by positive product announcements at Nvidia’s GTC 2025 conference.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Findings\\n\\n- **Price Performance:** NVDA fell from $117.27 (first open) to $101.49 (last close), a decline of -13.46%.\\n- **Volatility:** The stock experienced an annualized volatility of 89.16% and a maximum drawdown of -22.32%.\\n- **Volume:** Average daily trading volume was 326.95 million shares, with total volume over the month at 7.19 billion shares. Volume spiked during periods of sharp price decline.\\n- **News Impact:** The most significant negative catalyst was the announcement of new US export restrictions on Nvidia’s AI chips to China, which threatened a substantial portion of the company’s earnings. Additional pressure came from competitive advances by Huawei and analyst downgrades. Positive sentiment was generated by major product launches at GTC 2025 and reassurances from Nvidia’s CEO.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis\\n\\n### 1.

       "## Executive Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "Over the past month (March 19, 2025 – April 17, 2025), Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) experienced significant volatility, declining by approximately 13.5%. The period was marked by sharp price drops, high trading volumes, and a partial recovery. The primary drivers of this performance were negative regulatory developments, competitive pressures, and broader weakness in the technology sector, partially offset by positive product announcements at Nvidia’s GTC 2025 conference.\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Key Findings\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Price Performance:** NVDA fell from $117.27 (first open) to $101.49 (last close), a decline of -13.46%.\n",
       "- **Volatility:** The stock experienced an annualized volatility of 89.16% and a maximum drawdown of -22.32%.\n",
       "- **Volume:** Average daily trading volume was 326.95 million shares, with total volume over the month at 7.19 billion shares. Volume spiked during periods of sharp price decline.\n",
       "- **News Impact:** The most significant negative catalyst was the announcement of new US export restrictions on Nvidia’s AI chips to China, which threatened a substantial portion of the company’s earnings. Additional pressure came from competitive advances by Huawei and analyst downgrades. Positive sentiment was generated by major product launches at GTC 2025 and reassurances from Nvidia’s CEO.\n",
