    "# Milestone 4 Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "LangAlpha is a multi-agent AI equity analysis tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into the stock market. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic workflows to automate data gathering, processing, and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Programming Language:** Python\n",
    "*   **AI/LLM Frameworks:** LangChain, LangGraph\n",
    "*   **Core Agent Workflow:** Implemented in `src/agent/market_intelligence_agent` using LangGraph\n",
    "*   **Data Sources & Tools:**\n",
    "    *   **Market/Fundamental Data:** Polygon, Yahoo Finance (via `src/mcp_server/market_data.py`, `src/mcp_server/fundamental_data.py`)\n",
    "    *   **News/Web Research:** Tavily Search, Tickertick News API (via `src/mcp_server/tavily.py`, `src/mcp_server/tickertick.py`)\n",
    "    *   **Web Browsing:** Playwright (integrated via `browser` agent)\n",
    "    *   **Code Execution:** Local Python/Bash environment (via `coder` agent)\n",
    "    *   **Database:** We will use mongoDB to store the query history and the analysis result in production phase\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Market Intelligence Agent Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary functionality is delivered through a sophisticated **multi-agent system** built with **LangGraph**, located in `src/agent/market_intelligence_agent/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **User Query:** The system accepts natural language queries about financial markets, stocks, or economic events.\n",
    "2.  **Supervisor & Planner:** A `supervisor` agent oversees the entire process. It first consults a `planner` agent, which breaks down the user's request into a detailed, step-by-step research and analysis plan.\n",
    "3.  **Information Gathering (Parallel & Iterative):**\n",
    "    *   The `supervisor` delegates tasks based on the plan to specialized agents:\n",
    "        *   **`researcher`:** Fetches news (Tickertick) and performs general web searches (Tavily) for qualitative information, recent events, and context.\n",
    "        *   **`market`:** Retrieves quantitative data like stock prices, technical indicators, fundamental data (financials, valuation), and related metrics using dedicated tools connected to Polygon and Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "        *   **`browser`:** (Used sparingly due to cost) Performs deep web browsing for specific, hard-to-find information on given URLs when the `researcher`'s tools are insufficient.\n",
    "4.  **Analysis & Synthesis:**\n",
    "    *   **`coder`:** (If required by the plan) Executes Python code for complex calculations, data manipulation, or analysis beyond the `market` agent's built-in capabilities.\n",
    "    *   **`analyst`:** Acts as a financial expert (L/S Hedge Fund perspective). It synthesizes the information gathered by all other agents, identifies key insights, assesses risks, generates potential investment theses (Long/Short), and provides actionable financial analysis based *only* on the provided data.\n",
    "5.  **Reporting:**\n",
    "    *   The `supervisor` reviews the findings from all agents, potentially iterating or requesting clarifications.\n",
    "    *   Finally, a `reporter` agent compiles all the validated information and analysis into a comprehensive, well-structured Markdown report, including tables and summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Capabilities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Autonomous Research:** Agents collaboratively gather diverse data types (news, market data, fundamentals, web content).\n",
    "*   **In-depth Analysis:** Combines quantitative data retrieval with qualitative research and expert financial analysis.\n",
    "*   **Structured Planning:** Ensures a logical flow of information gathering and analysis tailored to the user's query.\n",
    "*   **Flexible Orchestration:** The `supervisor` dynamically routes tasks and manages the workflow, allowing for iteration and refinement.\n",
    "*   **Actionable Insights:** Aims to provide not just data, but synthesized analysis suitable for investment decision-making context (though not direct financial advice).\n",
