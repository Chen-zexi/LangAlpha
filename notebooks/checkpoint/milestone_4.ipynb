    "# Milestone 4 Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "LangAlpha is a multi-agent AI equity analysis tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into the stock market. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic workflows to automate data gathering, processing, and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Programming Language:** Python\n",
    "*   **AI/LLM Frameworks:** LangChain, LangGraph\n",
    "*   **Core Agent Workflow:** Implemented in `src/agent/market_intelligence_agent` using LangGraph\n",
    "*   **Data Sources & Tools:**\n",
    "    *   **Market/Fundamental Data:** Polygon, Yahoo Finance (via `src/mcp_server/market_data.py`, `src/mcp_server/fundamental_data.py`)\n",
    "    *   **News/Web Research:** Tavily Search, Tickertick News API (via `src/mcp_server/tavily.py`, `src/mcp_server/tickertick.py`)\n",
    "    *   **Web Browsing:** Playwright (integrated via `browser` agent)\n",
    "    *   **Code Execution:** Local Python/Bash environment (via `coder` agent)\n",
    "    *   **Database:** We will use mongoDB to store the query history and the analysis result in production phase\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Market Intelligence Agent Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary functionality is delivered through a sophisticated **multi-agent system** built with **LangGraph**, located in `src/agent/market_intelligence_agent/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **User Query:** The system accepts natural language queries about financial markets, stocks, or economic events.\n",
    "2.  **Supervisor & Planner:** A `supervisor` agent oversees the entire process. It first consults a `planner` agent, which breaks down the user's request into a detailed, step-by-step research and analysis plan.\n",
    "3.  **Information Gathering (Parallel & Iterative):**\n",
    "    *   The `supervisor` delegates tasks based on the plan to specialized agents:\n",
    "        *   **`researcher`:** Fetches news (Tickertick) and performs general web searches (Tavily) for qualitative information, recent events, and context.\n",
    "        *   **`market`:** Retrieves quantitative data like stock prices, technical indicators, fundamental data (financials, valuation), and related metrics using dedicated tools connected to Polygon and Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "        *   **`browser`:** (Used sparingly due to cost) Performs deep web browsing for specific, hard-to-find information on given URLs when the `researcher`'s tools are insufficient.\n",
    "4.  **Analysis & Synthesis:**\n",
    "    *   **`coder`:** (If required by the plan) Executes Python code for complex calculations, data manipulation, or analysis beyond the `market` agent's built-in capabilities.\n",
    "    *   **`analyst`:** Acts as a financial expert (L/S Hedge Fund perspective). It synthesizes the information gathered by all other agents, identifies key insights, assesses risks, generates potential investment theses (Long/Short), and provides actionable financial analysis based *only* on the provided data.\n",
    "5.  **Reporting:**\n",
    "    *   The `supervisor` reviews the findings from all agents, potentially iterating or requesting clarifications.\n",
    "    *   Finally, a `reporter` agent compiles all the validated information and analysis into a comprehensive, well-structured Markdown report, including tables and summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Capabilities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Autonomous Research:** Agents collaboratively gather diverse data types (news, market data, fundamentals, web content).\n",
    "*   **In-depth Analysis:** Combines quantitative data retrieval with qualitative research and expert financial analysis.\n",
    "*   **Structured Planning:** Ensures a logical flow of information gathering and analysis tailored to the user's query.\n",
    "*   **Flexible Orchestration:** The `supervisor` dynamically routes tasks and manages the workflow, allowing for iteration and refinement.\n",
    "*   **Actionable Insights:** Aims to provide not just data, but synthesized analysis suitable for investment decision-making context (though not direct financial advice).\n",

       "\n",
       "**Meta Platforms (META)** stands as a global leader in digital advertising and social platforms, with robust secular growth drivers in AI, messaging, and hardware innovation. Despite ongoing regulatory and Reality Labs headwinds, Meta’s core business generates exceptional free cash flow and trades at a discount to both intrinsic value and key peers.  \n",
       "- **Long-Term Outlook:** **Buy on weakness below $525**; fair value range $700–$792 (DCF/peer-based).  \n",
       "- **Short-Term Outlook:** **Neutral-bullish**; tactical long setup ($525–$530 entry, $555–$560 target).  \n",
       "- **Key Catalysts:** Q1 2025 earnings (April 30), new hardware launches, regulatory/legal developments.  \n",
       "- **Major Risks:** Regulatory fines, Reality Labs losses, macro ad-spend shocks.\n",

       "\n",
       "- **Macro:** Tech stocks face mixed macro data and regulatory scrutiny, but AI and hardware innovation remain strong sector themes.\n",
       "- **META Positioning:** Shares have lagged some AI peers but are consolidating after a strong multi-year run. Regulatory and content-liability risks weigh on valuation, while heavy AI and AR/VR investments create both opportunity and drag.\n",

       "- **AI & Product Innovation:** Heavy investment in AI (ad targeting, Llama models) and hardware (Ray-Ban Meta Glasses) positions Meta for future growth.\n",
       "- **Cost Controls:** Management is curbing Reality Labs losses and overall capex, supporting margin expansion.\n",
       "- **Valuation:** P/E (22.9x) and EV/EBITDA (16.2x) are below GOOGL despite similar growth/margins. DCF-based fair value is ~$792 (48% upside).\n",
       "- **Regulatory/Legal:** Fines in Nigeria, lawsuits in Ghana, and content scrutiny in India are headline risks, but current costs are manageable (<1% of FCF).\n",

       "\n",
       "- **Macro/Ad-Spend Sensitivity:** 5% ad-spend recession could cut revenue by 6–8% and EPS by 10–12%. Cost controls and non-ad revenue (WhatsApp, VR) provide some cushion.\n",
       "- **Reality Labs Losses:** Each $1B in extra losses reduces EPS by ~$0.40. Management aims to cut capex and achieve operating leverage by FY26.\n",
       "- **Regulatory/Legal:** EU/UK privacy rules could reduce ARPU by 2–3%. Fines/compliance costs (~$500M/year) are manageable relative to >$60B annual FCF, but escalation is a risk.\n",
       "- **Technical Downside:** Failure to hold $520 support could see a move to $500 (200-day SMA), representing ~6% downside from current levels.\n",

       "- **Long-Term Investors:** Accumulate META on weakness below $525. The company’s dominant ad platform, AI innovation, and strong cash flow support a fair value of $700–$792. Regulatory and Reality Labs risks are real but manageable.\n",
       "- **Short-Term Traders:** Consider tactical long positions on dips to $525–$530, targeting $555–$560. Watch for a breakout above $555 (with volume) for a swing to $580–$600.\n",
       "- **Monitor:** Q1 earnings (April 30), regulatory/legal headlines, and technical support at $520.\n",
