       "- **Major new tariffs and trade disputes have escalated sharply in 2025**, with the United States, China, the European Union, and Canada at the center of the action.\n",
       "- **Key sectors affected:** steel, aluminum, vehicles, semiconductors, energy, dairy, lumber, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods.\n",
       "- **Trade-flow disruptions are significant:** The IMF projects a potential 1.5% decline in global goods trade growth for 2025 if U.S. tariffs are fully implemented—the steepest drop since 2020.\n",
       "- **Negotiations and legal challenges are ongoing,** with several disputes now before the WTO and some retaliatory measures paused pending talks.\n",

       "The global trade environment in 2025 is marked by a resurgence of protectionist measures, with the U.S. leading a new wave of broad-based tariffs. This has triggered a series of retaliatory actions and legal challenges, particularly among major economies. The resulting uncertainty is impacting global supply chains, commodity prices, and inflation.\n",

       "  - Imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on Chinese goods (Feb 1, 2025).\n",
       "  - Introduced a 10% global tariff on all imports (Apr 5, 2025), with further increases for 57 countries under negotiation.\n",
       "  - Additional sector-specific tariffs remain, especially on steel, aluminum, vehicles, chips, and pharmaceuticals.\n",
       "  - Threatened up to 200% tariffs on French luxury spirits.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **China:**\n",
       "  - Responded with counter-tariffs on U.S. coal, LNG, and agricultural machinery.\n",
       "  - Raised some tariffs on U.S. goods to as high as 125%.\n",

       "\n",

       "- **Prepare for volatility:** Supply chain managers and investors should anticipate continued price and sourcing volatility, especially in the most affected sectors.\n",
       "- **Engage in scenario planning:** Consider the impact of both further escalation and potential de-escalation in trade tensions on business operations and investment decisions.\n",
