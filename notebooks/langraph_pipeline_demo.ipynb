       "\n",
       "### 1. **Long BYD ADRs (BYDDY/BYDDF)**\n",
       "- **Rationale:** Best-in-class risk/reward, proven profitability, global expansion, and moderate valuation.\n",
       "- **Target:** +25% medium-term upside (re-rating to peer multiples).\n",
       "- **Stop:** -12% (half historical drawdown).\n",
       "- **Timeframe:** 6–12 months, focus on export ramp and margin trends.\n",
       "- **Conviction:** **High**\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Relative-Value Pair: Long Li Auto (LI) / Short XPeng (XPEV)**\n",
       "- **Rationale:** Capture growth and execution gap; both exposed to sector macro/policy.\n",
       "- **Target:** 20% spread narrowing (LI outperformance).\n",
       "- **Stop:** 10% adverse move.\n",
       "- **Timeframe:** Through Q3 2024 BEV launch.\n",
       "- **Conviction:** **Medium**\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Monitor NIO (NIO)**\n",
       "- **Rationale:** Optionality on battery swap tech and delivery rebound, but require evidence of sustained profitability before long exposure.\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Key Risks\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Geopolitical:** U.S./EU tariffs, ADR delisting, regulatory scrutiny.\n",
       "- **Sector:** Price wars, subsidy phase-outs, raw material cost inflation.\n",
       "- **Company-specific:** Execution on new models (Li Auto), margin compression (BYD), capital needs (NIO, XPeng).\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "- **BYD** is the preferred long for hedge funds seeking Chinese EV exposure with lower volatility and proven execution.\n",
       "- **Li Auto** offers high growth but with higher risk; best expressed as a pair against XPeng.\n",
       "- **NIO** and **XPeng** are speculative, with high volatility and ongoing losses.\n",
