# NVIDIA (NVDA) Two-Month Performance Report  
*Period: February 21, 2025 – April 17, 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

- **NVIDIA’s share price declined approximately 6% over the past two months**, underperforming the broader market and semiconductor sector.
- **Earnings strength was offset by regulatory headwinds**—notably U.S.-China export curbs—and heightened sector volatility.
- **Trading was highly volatile** (annualized volatility ~62%), with large price swings around earnings, macroeconomic news, and regulatory developments.
- **Actionable insight:** Investors should closely monitor upcoming earnings, regulatory updates, and sector sentiment, as these factors are likely to drive continued volatility and present both risks and opportunities.

---

## 6. Conclusions & Recommendations

- **Earnings strength is not enough:** Despite robust revenue and AI leadership, NVIDIA’s stock is highly sensitive to regulatory and macro headwinds.
- **Regulatory risk is the key variable:** U.S.-China export controls have a direct, quantifiable impact on revenue and market share.
- **Sector volatility is elevated:** NVDA’s high correlation with the SOX index and outsized volatility suggest that sector-wide moves will continue to drive the stock.
- **Investor strategy:** Consider a risk-managed approach—monitoring for oversold conditions on regulatory-driven dips, and using upcoming earnings and product launches as potential catalysts for recovery or further volatility.
