Technical Analysis (1\\\\u20133 months)\\\\n\\\\u2022 Current Price (4/25/25): $547.27\\\\n\\\\u2022 Moving Averages: 20-day SMA $521; 50-day SMA $500; 200-day SMA $450 (all rising) \\\\u2192 Bullish alignment\\\\n\\\\u2022 RSI (14): ~65 \\\\u2192 Neutral-to-slightly overbought\\\\n\\\\u2022 MACD: Positive histogram, MACD line above signal \\\\u2192 Uptrend confirmed\\\\n\\\\u2022 Bollinger Bands: Price trading near upper band \\\\u2192 Short-term volatility high\\\\n\\\\u2022 Golden Cross: 50-day SMA crossed above 200-day SMA in March \\\\u2192 Medium-term bullish signal\\\\n\\\\u2022 Key Support: $520 (20-day MA), $500 (50-day MA), $480 (recent swing low)\\\\n\\\\u2022 Key Resistance: $580 (Feb high-side congestion), $600 round-number zone\\\\n\\\\u2022 Volume: Above-average on up-days \\\\u2192 Institutional buying\\\\n\\\\nInterpretation: The chart shows sustained strength but a mild overbought condition. A pullback to $500\\\\u2013520 could offer a lower-risk entry. Break above $580 may open another leg to $600\\\\u2013650.\\\\n\\\\n2. Fundamental Outlook (TTM through Q1\\\\u201925)\\\\n\\\\u2022 Revenue: $143B (2024 TTM), Q1\\\\u201925 rev. $36.7B (+23% y/y)\\\\n\\\\u2022 EPS & FCF: Q1\\\\u201925 EPS $4.51 vs. $3.30 y/y; FCF margin ~35%\\\\n\\\\u2022 Margins: Operating margin ~40%; net margin ~35%\\\\n\\\\u2022 Balance Sheet: Net cash ~$10B; Debt/EBITDA <0.5x \\\\u2192 Strong liquidity\\\\n\\\\u2022 Shares Outstanding: ~2.6B, down 3% y/y (repurchases)\\\\n\\\\u2022 Valuation: P/E ~31x, EV/EBITDA ~23x, P/FCF ~28x vs. Tech peers P/E ~30x, P/FCF ~25x\\\\n\\\\u2022 Consensus Growth: Analysts project 18\\\\u201320% revenue CAGR (2025\\\\u201327)\\\\n\\\\nInterpretation: Meta trades in line with high-growth tech multiples but below hyper-growth peers (e.g., SNAP, Netflix).

Short-Term Trading View\\\\nBase Case (60% probability): Price chops between $520\\\\u2013580 into earnings. Trade the range, buying dips near $520 with stops at $500, targeting $575\\\\u2013580 on rallies.\\\\nEarnings Beat Scenario (25%):  Q1 upside on ad-rebound news \\\\u2192 Break above $580 and test $600\\\\u2013650.\\\\nEarnings Miss Scenario (15%): Guidance cut or regulatory surprise \\\\u2192 Pullback to $480, retesting 200-day MA.\\\\n\\\\n5. Long-Term Investment Case (12\\\\u201336 months)\\\\nBull Thesis\\\\n\\\\u2022 Durable Ad Franchise: 20%+ annual ad revenue growth from AI-driven targeting and Reels monetization\\\\n\\\\u2022 Metaverse Optionality: Reality Labs investment (25% of cap-ex) could yield new revenue streams by 2027\\\\n\\\\u2022 Balance Sheet & Buybacks: Divestitures and share repurchases support EPS growth\\\\n\\\\nBear Thesis\\\\n\\\\u2022 Regulatory & Legal Risks: EU/US antitrust fines, privacy litigation (Nigeria, Ghana, India)\\\\n\\\\u2022 Execution: Reality Labs cash burn (>$13B in 2024) with uncertain ROI\\\\n\\\\u2022 Competition: Apple\\\\u2019s Vision Pro, TikTok\\\\u2019s ad moat, and Google\\\\u2019s AI offerings\\\\n\\\\nValuation & Targets: Using a discounted-cash-flow model with 15% WACC and 20% revenue growth, fair value = $650 in 24 months (implying ~18% annualized upside).\\\\n\\\\n6. Recommendation\\\\nShort Term: HOLD or ACCUMULATE on dips to $500\\\\u2013520 with a stop-loss at $480. Avoid chasing above $580 pre-earnings.\\\\nLong Term: BUY at current levels or better. Core position for growth/AI theme; add on regulatory-driven pullbacks toward $450\\\\u2013480.\\\\n\\\\nRisk Management\\\\n\\\\u2022 Position Size: Limit to 3\\\\u20135% of portfolio given high beta\\\\n\\\\u2022 Stops: Tight (4\\\\u20136% below entry) for tactical trades; wider (10\\\\u201315%) for strategic build\\\\n\\\\u2022 Diversification: Hedge with less volatile tech/mega-cap or use options collars around earnings\\\\n\\\\nConclusion\\\\nMeta remains a compelling long-term growth story with attractive fundamentals, strong cash flows, and AI/metaverse optionality.
