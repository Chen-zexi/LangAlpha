# Market Context

The global trade environment in 2025 is marked by a resurgence of protectionist measures, with the U.S. leading a new wave of broad-based tariffs. This has triggered a series of retaliatory actions and legal challenges, particularly among major economies. The resulting uncertainty is impacting global supply chains, commodity prices, and inflation.

## Trade-Flow Disruptions

- **IMF estimates:** If U.S. broad tariffs are fully implemented, global goods trade growth could decline by **1.5% in 2025**—the largest drop since the pandemic.
- **Inflation:** Sector-specific price increases have contributed an estimated **0.2–0.4 percentage points** to consumer inflation in the U.S. and EU.
- **Supply Chains:** Companies are diversifying away from the U.S. and China, increasing near-term production costs.

# Future Outlook

- **Negotiations:** Ongoing talks between the U.S., EU, China, and Canada may prevent further escalation, but the risk of new or higher tariffs remains.
- **WTO Rulings:** Legal outcomes on Section 232 tariffs and other disputes could set important precedents for the use of "national security" as a justification for trade barriers.
- **Supply Chain Realignment:** Continued diversification away from major economies is likely, with increased costs and complexity in the short term.
- **Election Risks:** U.S. midterm elections and other political developments could shift trade policy direction.

---

# Conclusions and Recommendations

- **Monitor sector-specific developments:** Companies in steel, autos, semiconductors, and agriculture should closely track tariff announcements and retaliatory measures.
- **Prepare for volatility:** Supply chain managers and investors should anticipate continued price and sourcing volatility, especially in the most affected sectors.
- **Engage in scenario planning:** Consider the impact of both further escalation and potential de-escalation in trade tensions on business operations and investment decisions.
- **Stay informed on legal outcomes:** WTO rulings and ongoing negotiations will shape the future trade landscape.
