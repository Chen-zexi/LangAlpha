## Actionable Recommendations

### 1. **Long BYD ADRs (BYDDY/BYDDF)**
- **Rationale:** Best-in-class risk/reward, proven profitability, global expansion, and moderate valuation.
- **Target:** +25% medium-term upside (re-rating to peer multiples).
- **Stop:** -12% (half historical drawdown).
- **Timeframe:** 6–12 months, focus on export ramp and margin trends.
- **Conviction:** **High**

### 2. **Relative-Value Pair: Long Li Auto (LI) / Short XPeng (XPEV)**
- **Rationale:** Capture growth and execution gap; both exposed to sector macro/policy.
- **Target:** 20% spread narrowing (LI outperformance).
- **Stop:** 10% adverse move.
- **Timeframe:** Through Q3 2024 BEV launch.
- **Conviction:** **Medium**

### 3. **Monitor NIO (NIO)**
- **Rationale:** Optionality on battery swap tech and delivery rebound, but require evidence of sustained profitability before long exposure.

## Key Risks

- **Geopolitical:** U.S./EU tariffs, ADR delisting, regulatory scrutiny.
- **Sector:** Price wars, subsidy phase-outs, raw material cost inflation.
- **Company-specific:** Execution on new models (Li Auto), margin compression (BYD), capital needs (NIO, XPeng).

---

## Conclusion

- **BYD** is the preferred long for hedge funds seeking Chinese EV exposure with lower volatility and proven execution.
- **Li Auto** offers high growth but with higher risk; best expressed as a pair against XPeng.
- **NIO** and **XPeng** are speculative, with high volatility and ongoing losses.
