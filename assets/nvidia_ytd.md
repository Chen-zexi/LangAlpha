- **Policy:** Clarity on U.S.–China export controls

## Conclusions and Recommendations

- **NVDA’s YTD decline reflects a shift from peak AI optimism to a more cautious outlook on growth and policy risk.**
- **Fundamentals remain strong** (robust revenue/EPS growth, expanding margins), but valuation compression and event-driven volatility have created a more attractive risk/reward profile for long-term investors.
- **Actionable Insight:** Investors should monitor upcoming earnings, product launches, and policy developments for potential inflection points.
